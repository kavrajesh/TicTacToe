My friend and I developed this rudimentary version of TicTacToe using Python for a class project. Have fun playing!

Current Version Rules/Capabilities:
1. Only two-player option available
2. Currently does not account for ties
3. Data validation and Error handling in place where necessary
4. Illegal moves are not allowed (i.e. cannot play a position that is already filled)
