My friend and I developed this rudimentary version of TicTacToe using Python for a class project. Have fun playing with a friend!

Current Version Rules/Capabilities:
1. Only two-player option available
2. Currently does not account for ties
3. Data validation and Error handling in place where necessary
4. Illegal moves are not allowed (i.e. cannot play a position that is already filled)


This was created using Replit and Idle. Hence, this code can be used on either platform (and more) to enjoy the two-player game.
